Install
=======

For installing ANSI Common Lisp
`$ sudo apt install sbcl` 

The command line being a bit "old school" you may want to have history and the use of left and right arrow by installing rlwrap

`$ sudo apt install rlwrap`

For bash user you may want to creat the small and practical alias. When in the home directory and add this line to your `bash_aliases`

`alias lisp="rlwrap sbcl"`
